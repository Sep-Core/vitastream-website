                  We are a cross-disciplinary team combining product thinking, industrial design, embedded systems,
                  and software engineering. Our work focuses on practical sustainability: making graywater reuse
                  reliable, safe, and easy to adopt in everyday settings. We iterate fast with prototypes, validate
                  decisions through testing, and keep user experience simple and transparent. By turning “waste”
                  into measurable savings, we aim to help households and small public facilities reduce both water
                  usage and long-term costs.

                  <li><strong>Insight →</strong> We noticed that sink graywater is often clean enough for non-drinking reuse, yet it is routinely discarded.</li>
